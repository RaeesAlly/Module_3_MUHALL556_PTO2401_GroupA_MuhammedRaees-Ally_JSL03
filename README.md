REFLECTION:Analyzing these examples taught me a lot. Imperative programming is about how to do things with detailed steps and changing variables, while declarative programming is more about what needs to be done with fixed variables and high-level descriptions, making the code simpler and easier to understand. Knowing both helps me pick the right approach for different tasks and stresses the importance of clear, maintainable code. This analysis has given me valuable insights for writing efficient programs.
